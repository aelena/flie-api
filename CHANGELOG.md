## [0.3.0]

A modernization pass over a codebase that had been sitting for six months.
It did not build on checkout: floating version ranges (`5.*`, `8.*`) had drifted
Scriban onto a release carrying a critical advisory, and `NuGetAudit` failed
restore before a line of C# was read.

### Security

- **Share links ignored every restriction they recorded.** `GET /share/{token}`
  looked the row up, bumped the access counter, and returned the report. It never
  checked `expires_at`, never verified `password_hash`, and never consulted
  `allowed_emails`. An expired link worked indefinitely and a password-protected
  link opened for anyone holding the URL — the password was write-only. Expiry now
  answers `410`, a missing or wrong password `401` (compared in fixed time), and a
  link restricted to named recipients `403`.
- **The JWT signing algorithm was unpinned.** Neither validation path passed
  `ValidAlgorithms`, so the handler accepted whatever `alg` a token declared.
  `AppSettings.JwtAlgorithm` existed to name the algorithm in use and was read by
  nothing. It is now the single accepted algorithm, restricted to the HMAC family.
- **The placeholder JWT secret would have shipped.** Anyone who has read this
  repository could mint a valid session with it. Outside `Development` the
  application now refuses to start while it is still in place, or while the secret
  is too short to sign with.
- **Caller-supplied regexes ran without a match timeout.** Both the pattern and the
  text come from the caller, so `^(a+)+$` against a long run of `a`s pinned a
  thread until the process died. Every caller pattern now carries a 2s timeout and
  reports `400` when it expires.
- Scriban `5.12.1` → `7.2.6`, clearing the advisory that broke restore.

### Fixed — operations that silently did nothing

- **`/pdf/redact` returned unredacted documents.** It counted matches, copied the
  PDF through untouched, and returned it as `<name>_redacted.pdf` with a non-zero
  redaction count and a `200`. Text the caller asked to have removed was still
  selectable and extractable. Now `501`, matching the `/redact` endpoint that
  already answered that way.
- **`/pdf/extract-tables` always reported zero tables.** It opened the document,
  ignored it, and returned an empty list with a `200` — indistinguishable from a
  PDF that genuinely contains no tables. Now `501`, pointing at the text and
  Markdown extractors that do work.
- `CompressPdf` accepts `imageQuality` and `dpi` and applies neither. It does
  genuinely compress (object streams and the cross-reference table), so it still
  answers normally, but the limitation is documented on the method instead of
  living in a `TODO`.

### Fixed — error reporting

- **Caller mistakes were reported as `500`.** Core signalled expected failures with
  `ArgumentException`, `FormatException`, or whatever iText threw; only
  `FileApiException` was mapped to a status code. A mistyped page range answered
  `500 "An unexpected error occurred."` The CLI printed a raw stack trace for the
  same reason. `ErrorContractTests` now pins ten of these against the real HTTP
  surface.
- **RFC 9457 responses were not `application/problem+json`.** `WriteProblem`
  assigned `Response.ContentType` and then called `WriteAsJsonAsync`, which
  overwrites it, so every error went out as `application/json` — defeating the one
  thing the media type exists for.
- `PageRangeParser`: out-of-bounds pages and malformed tokens now answer `400`
  naming the problem; a reversed range like `8-5` is rejected instead of quietly
  selecting nothing; a selection matching no page is rejected rather than returning
  an empty document with a `200`.
- Only `GetMetrics` handled an unreadable PDF; the other 23 entry points let
  iText's exception escape. Both failure points now produce a `422` describing what
  is wrong with the file, and a password-protected PDF says so everywhere.
- `SearchEndpoints` told callers `query` and `pattern` could both be supplied,
  then rejected exactly that.
- An oversized upload answered `400` quoting `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`, a server
  environment variable the caller cannot see. Now `413` with both sizes in MB.

### Fixed — leaks, races, and resource use

- `AuthRateLimitMiddleware` kept a static per-date bucket that was never evicted:
  one permanent entry per day per caller, for the life of the process.
- `AuditLogMiddleware` had no `try/finally` and sat inside the exception handler,
  so no failing request was ever audited and rate-limited requests never reached
  it — the entries anyone reading an audit log is looking for. It is now outermost
  and logs in a `finally`.
- `InMemoryJobStore` trimmed without synchronisation: two concurrent `Set` calls at
  capacity each computed their own excess from a separate snapshot and could evict
  jobs a caller was still polling for.
- `ShareRepository` used double-checked locking on a non-volatile field, so a
  second thread could take a connection the first had not finished opening.
- Uploads were copied three times, through eleven duplicated
  `CopyToAsync`-then-`ToArray` helpers, in a service built for large documents.
  One shared reader sizes the buffer from `IFormFile.Length`, and threads the
  request's cancellation token — which none of the copies did.
- The composite file hash allocated a second copy of the whole file to concatenate
  a prefix; it is now hashed incrementally.
- `ZipService` caught failures from the `ZipArchive` constructor only, so an
  archive with a good header and a damaged central directory escaped as a `500`.

### Changed — licensing

- **PDF moved into its own package, `Aelena.FileApi.Core.Pdf`, licensed
  AGPL-3.0-or-later.** `Aelena.FileApi.Core` declared MIT while depending on
  iText 7, which is AGPL with `requireLicenseAcceptance`. Publishing that would
  have told consumers they had permissive terms while pulling copyleft code into
  their build. `Core` now has no reference to iText, direct or transitive, and CI
  asserts it by inspecting the packed `.nuspec` on every push.
- **`-p:IncludePdf=false` builds the repository without the AGPL part.** A clone
  contains everything, so the package split alone does not help someone who clones.
  The switch drops the project reference, the `/pdf/*` endpoints, the `fileapi pdf`
  commands and the PDF gRPC methods; the published output contains no iText
  assembly at all. CI builds, tests and publishes both ways and fails if iText
  appears in the opt-out output.
- `LICENSING.md` documents which package is which, what the AGPL means for a
  network service, and how to opt out; the README leads with it.
- **The CLI is packaged as a .NET global tool**: `dotnet tool install -g
  Aelena.FileApi.Cli` puts `fileapi` on the PATH. It carries PDF, so it is AGPL.

### Changed


- **Retargeted to .NET 10 / C# 14**, and multi-targeted `net10.0;net11.0` — both
  build and test green. `publish` and `run` need `-f`; see the README.
- **Central Package Management** (`Directory.Packages.props`) with exact pins,
  covering the `grpc/` minirepo from the same file. Floating ranges are how the
  Scriban drift happened silently.
- **CLI ported to System.CommandLine 2.0.** The pinned `2.0.0-beta4` dated from
  2022 and its API is gone in the GA release. Along the way: `image resize -h 100`
  never set a height (`-h` is bound to `--help`); failures now reach the user as
  one line on stderr with a meaningful exit code; and a helper that called
  `Environment.Exit(1)` was removed in favour of parser-level validation.
- **FluentAssertions → AwesomeAssertions.** FluentAssertions 8 moved to a paid
  licence for commercial use; this is the MIT-licensed community fork.
- **Culture correctness.** Markdown export, ZIP CRCs, PDF page labels, and the
  rate-limit bucket key were formatted in the ambient culture, so their output
  changed shape with the machine. Those are pinned to invariant; CLI display is
  explicitly current-culture.
- **The `.editorconfig` made the build depend on the installed SDK.** Its legacy
  `value:severity` syntax was not read by the newer analyzers, which fell back to
  opposite defaults — installing the .NET 11 SDK turned a clean build into 550
  style errors on unchanged code. Options and severities are now declared
  separately.
- Source-generated `LoggerMessage` delegates in the API layer; source-generated
  regexes in `PiiService`; `ShareRepository` returns records instead of `dynamic`
  (converting its two callers surfaced 16 previously runtime-only errors).
- Language detection counted markers by scanning for `" the "` — a space either
  side — which cannot see a marker opening the text, closing it, or against
  punctuation or a newline. It now counts whole words.

### Added

- GitHub Actions: CI builds and tests on Linux and Windows across both target
  frameworks, packs all three packages, asserts the MIT/AGPL boundary, builds the
  Docker image, and runs the MIT-only configuration. A tag-driven release workflow
  packs, re-checks the licence boundary, verifies the tag matches the package
  version, and publishes to NuGet.

- `ErrorContractTests`, `ShareAccessTests`, and `JwtCookieAuthTests` — the last
  covering a component that had no tests at all, despite being the only thing
  between a request and an identity.
- Test count: **223 → 298 distinct tests**. Because every project multi-targets,
  `dotnet test` on the main solution reports **580 passing** — 290 tests run once
  on net10.0 and once on net11.0. The gRPC solution adds 8 more, so 596 executions
  in total.
